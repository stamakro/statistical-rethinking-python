collider bias

# 6E2
Multi-colinearity between labels in multi-label classification creates spurious label correlations

1. A -> B -> C (pipe) C _|_ A | B
2. A <- B -> C (common cause/fork) C _|_ A | B
3. A -> B <- C (collider)
4. Descendant

# 6E4
Biased sampling implies that certain feature combinations are excluded. The collider variable is in this case is whether a certain 'sample' can be observed or not
